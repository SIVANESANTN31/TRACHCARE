<h1>TrachCare - Optimizing Tracheostomy Care</h1>

<h2>Definitions</h2>
<p>
  Tracheostomy, a surgical procedure involving the creation of an airway
  through the neck, is often necessitated by various medical conditions,
  including respiratory failure, trauma, or prolonged intubation.
  Following tracheostomy, patients require meticulous care to manage their
  airways effectively, prevent complications, and optimize their quality
  of life. However, providing adequate care at home can be challenging for
  patients and caregivers due to the complexity of tracheostomy management
  and the need for continuous monitoring and intervention.
</p>

<h2>Mobile Health Applications in Tracheostomy Care</h2>
<p>
  In response to these challenges, the development of mobile health
  applications has emerged as a promising solution to support patients and
  caregivers in managing tracheostomy care at home. TrachCare is one such
  mobile application designed to optimize tracheostomy care by providing a
  comprehensive range of features.
</p>

<h2>Features of TrachCare</h2>
<p>
  TrachCare includes informative videos to educate patients on essential
  tasks such as:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Cleaning the inner tube</li>
  <li>Changing tracheostomy ties</li>
  <li>Performing daily cleaning and dressing around the tube site</li>
  <li>Proper suctioning technique, etc.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Empowering Patients and Caregivers</h2>
<p>
  By leveraging the capabilities of mobile technology, TrachCare aims to
  empower patients and caregivers with the knowledge, tools, and support
  needed to navigate the complexities of tracheostomy care effectively.
</p>

<h2>Research and Evaluation</h2>
<p>
  This abstract outlines the rationale behind the development of this
  application and its potential to improve the quality of life for
  post-operative tracheostomy patients. Through a comprehensive evaluation
  of effectiveness and user experience of this app, this research aims to
  assess the impact of mobile application optimization on home
  tracheostomy care and patient outcomes. By exploring the usability,
  acceptability, and clinical benefits of TrachCare, this study seeks to
  contribute to the growing body of evidence supporting the integration of
  mobile health technology in tracheostomy care management.
